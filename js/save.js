	.addField("Hey look it's the first Announcement!","Everyone who has joined the Discord from the Teamspeak this is NOT A REPLACEMENT. This is for being able communicate with each other that doesn't involve our actual voice! The text chats on Discord allow us to send notices and have a better system to announce big changes (Hey like this one!) that we wouldn't be able to do on Teamspeak. Now the Discord ranking system is a little bit different than the TS. First of all it's less strict and more simple. Members are just Members of the Discord community and Senior Members are mainly TS DS. This means we can grow our community much more outside of Arma as not everyone uses Teamspeak or will try it. So instead of an application on the forums then being voice interviewed. On here an APP is put in then an Officer accepts them. Feel free to invite anyone who is able to follow rules, but Member here isn't same as TS DS Tag. All of this is still in the works and changes will come, but until then enjoy the Servers Emotes and the <#533314622275715108> chat")
